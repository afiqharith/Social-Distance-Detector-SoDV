# Social Distance using pre-trained YOLOv3 model

> The initial idea of this project is to use MobileNet SSD with Caffe implementation as the person detection algorithm. After I've finished my Final Year Project on July 2020, I decided to further improve the detection algorithm by using YOLOv3 to increase the accuracy
>
> Social distance using distance formula
> Drawback:
>
> - No camera calibration for intrinsic parameter

_Install the dependencies on command line:_

```sh
pip3 install -r requirement.txt
```

_To run the program on command line:_

```sh
python3 social-distance-yolo.py
```

**Future upgrade:**

- Camera calibration for intrinsic parameter (distance)
